# Graduate Outcomes Tool

The Graduate Outcomes Tool (the Tool), developed by Universities New Zealand (UNZ), presents the economic and employment outcomes of tertiary graduates who completed studies between 2009 and 2015, and follows their outcomes for up to 6 years following the completion of their studies.

The Graduate Outcomes Tool was developed using the Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI). Monthly indicators on the economic outcomes of graduates are constructed to present a dynamic story about the transition and outcomes of graduates. The Tool sets out the outcomes of domestic graduates by ethnicity, gender, level of study, subsector (university or non-university graduates) and broad field of completed study. Outcomes for typical young or mature domestic graduates can be analysed separately, while outcomes for international graduates are grouped only by level of study, subsector and broad field of study.
